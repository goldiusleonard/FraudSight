    As an expert intent categorizer, analyze the following user input and classify it as either 'data-related inquiry' or 'general inquiry' based on these criteria:

    Classify as 'data-related inquiry' if the input matches ANY of these patterns:
    1. Starts with or contains data action verbs (regardless of tense):
       - show/shows/showing
       - display/displays/displaying
       - get/gets/getting
       - list/lists/listing
       - find/finds/finding
       - give/gives/giving
       - fetch/fetches/fetching
    2. Contains visualization-related terms:
       - plot/plots/plotting
       - graph/graphs/graphing
       - visualize/visualizes/visualizing
       - chart/charts/charting
    3. Asks for metrics using phrases like:
       - "how many"
       - "what's the count"
       - "total number of"
       - "sum of"
       
    Classify as 'general inquiry' ONLY if the input:
    1. Contains reasoning/explanation terms:
       - why
       - how come
       - what's the reason
       - explain why
       - analyze why
       - interpret why
    2. Asks about causation/correlation:
       - what caused
       - what led to
       - how does X affect Y
       - what's the relationship between
   

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    - If the input starts with ANY data action verb (show, display, get, etc.), ALWAYS classify as 'data-related inquiry'
    - Simple commands like "show transactions" or "display users" are ALWAYS 'data-related inquiry'
    - Only classify as 'general inquiry' if there's a clear request for reasoning or explanation
    - If the user is asking is making greeting or ask to introduce yourself, it should be 'general inquiry'

    Examples:

    Must be classified as data-related inquiry:
    - "show transactions"
    - "show me transactions"
    - "display users"
    - "get anomalies"
    - "list all accounts"
    - "find suspicious users"
    - "give me the data"
    - "Show today's fraud transaction"

    Must be classified as general inquiry:
    - "why are these transactions suspicious?"
    - "what caused this anomaly?"
    - "explain why user 123 is flagged"
    - "how come this pattern exists?"
    - "What can you do?"
    - "What are the trading fraud terms?"

    
    When in doubt:
    - If the query starts with a data action verb → ALWAYS data-related inquiry
    - If no explicit reasoning/explanation terms → default to data-related inquiry

    As an expert intent categorizer, analyze the following user input and classify it as either 'reasoning about a particular data' or 'data-related inquiry' based on these criteria:

    Classify as 'reasoning about a particular data' if the input:

       - "what is the total..."
       - "what is the count..."
       - "what is the sum..."
       - "what is the average..."
       - "how many..."

       - Questions using "which" about specific records
       - Questions using "where" about specific data
       - Questions using "what" about specific metrics or values

    Classify as 'data-related inquiry' if the input matches ANY of these patterns:

       - chart/charts/charting
       
    Classify as 'general inquiry' if the input matches the general greeting or general question

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    - ANY question about specific numbers, metrics, or quantities is 'reasoning about a particular data'
    - Questions seeking calculations or aggregations are 'reasoning about a particular data'
    - Questions about specific data points or patterns are 'reasoning about a particular data'
    - Questions about general questions or general greeting are 'general inquiry'

    Examples:

    Must be classified as 'reasoning about a particular data':
    - "What is the total number of transactions?"
    - "How many users are active?"
    - "Why is user_id 123 showing high transactions?"
    - "Which accounts have suspicious activity?"
    - "What is the average transaction amount?"
    - "Where are the most transactions occurring?"
    - "How much revenue was generated yesterday?"
    - "Which is the flag reason for highest fraud?"

    Must be classified as 'data-related inquiry':
    - "show the highest fraud transactions"
    - "Show today's fraud transaction"
    
    Must be classified as 'general inquiry':
    - "Who are you"
    - What can you do"
    - "Hi"
    -"Who is the president of America"
    -"What are the trading fraud terms?"




    When in doubt:
    - If the question involves numbers, counts, or specific data points → 'reasoning about a particular data'
    - If the question is about data action verbs → 'data-related inquiry'
    - If the question involves  general questions or general greeting  → 'general inquiry'
